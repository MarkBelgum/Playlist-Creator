# Playlist-Creator
The Best Playlist Creator Ever! Takes a random song from every album of an artist you have music files and makes a playlist in the album order of your choosing. I initially created this to spice up listening to my favorite artists when I couldn't choose one album to listen to.

TLDR: modify the variables in lines 5-10 for your files
