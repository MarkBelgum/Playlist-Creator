# Playlist-Creator
The Best Playlist Creator Ever! Takes a random song from every album of an artist you have music files and makes a playlist in the album order of your choosing. I initially created this to spice up listening to my favorite artists when I couldn't choose one album to listen to.

TLDR: modify the variables in lines 5-10 for your files

```python
artistPath="/Users/markbelgum/Music/Queen/"
albums=["Queen","Queen II","Sheer Heart Attack","A Night At The Opera","A Day At The Races","News Of The World","Jazz",
        "The Game","Flash Gordon","Hot Space","The Works","A Kind Of Magic","The Miracle","Innuendo","Made In Heaven"]
filePath="/Users/markbelgum/Documents/Music/Custom Playlists/Queen.m3u"
cycles=12   # number of times the playlist will cycle through the albums
```
